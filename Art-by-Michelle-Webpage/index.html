          <blockquote>
            "I have bought two pins from (Michelle) - the orange shirt day pin
            and a poppy pin. Both are beautiful. Michelle customized both pins
            for me so they were perfect. Shipping to Hamilton, Ontario was
            inexpensive and appreciated as a customer. I have received many
            compliments about my pins and feel great wearing them. I love that
            both purchases included a donation. Thanks Michelle for the
            excellent customer service and beautifully hand crafted artistic
            pins."

            "AMAZING quality and hard work put into every piece. Michelle truly
            takes the time to create beautiful art. I've got a few pieces and I
            LOVE them all."

            "I have purchased on several occasions from (Michelle).. ecah item
            has come packaged beautifully and each piece is made with absolute
            care and love. Every piece I own is absolutely beautiful, the detail
            is insane. I get compliments all the time on pieces I wear! Not only
            are the products amazing, the owner is the sweetest! The hand
            written notes, the reposts on social media when you tag her in posts
            thanking you for purchasing. I 100% recommended purchasing one of
            her beautiful crafted pieces, you won't regret it!"
